Vendure is a headless commerce platform, that means we are following an API-first approach, offering two API interfaces:

- _Shop API_: An extensible, customizable and secure GraphQL API for all your operations needed in your storefront or other custom frontends, like mobile apps, POS, wearables or more.
- _Admin API_: An extensible, customizable and secure GraphQL API for back office and management operations that is powering the Vendure Admin Central, our customizable admin UI.

The Vendure architecture consists of three core components:

⚙️ **Commerce Engine**

Our commerce engine is built to handle use-cases in any business model and of any scale. Experience the first platform where customization lives within its DNA.
