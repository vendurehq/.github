<h1 align="center">Headless Enterprise Ecommerce</h1>
<h3 align="center">Built on an Open Source Core</h3>

Vendure is the ecommerce platform for teams tackling complex commerce challenges: B2B, multi-vendor marketplaces, subscriptions, and custom business models that off-the-shelf solutions can't handle.

## Platform Overview

**Commerce Framework** — Built with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), offering a Shop API for storefronts and customer-facing touchpoints, and an Admin API for back-office operations. Designed for customization and extensibility from day one.

**Admin Dashboard** — A modern [React](https://react.dev/)-based UI built with [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/) and [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), fully customizable and extensible to match your operational workflows.
